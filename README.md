# Online Learning Platform with GPT-3 Integration

## Project Overview
This project is an online learning platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It allows students to register, log in, browse courses, enroll in courses, and receive personalized course recommendations using GPT-3. Instructors can create, update, and delete their courses, as well as view the list of enrolled students.

This project demonstrates role-based access control (students vs. instructors), CRUD operations for courses, JWT-based authentication, and integration with OpenAI GPT-3 API for smart recommendations. The backend is fully functional, and the frontend is designed to be user-friendly with basic styling.

## System Architecture
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express.js
- **Frontend:** React.js (Create React App)
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Token)
- **GPT-3 Integration:** OpenAI API

The backend exposes RESTful APIs for authentication, course management, enrollment, and GPT-3 recommendations.  
Frontend communicates with backend via HTTP requests to render data and perform actions.
